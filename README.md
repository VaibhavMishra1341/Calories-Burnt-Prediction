## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to estimate the number of calories burned during exercise sessions. We utilize advanced machine learning techniques to construct models that precisely predict calorie expenditure based on diverse user features.

## Dataset

The dataset encompasses exercise and user data, encompassing critical attributes such as age, height, weight, gender, and the corresponding calories burned during exercise.

## Data Preprocessing

- Combined exercise and user data based on common identifiers.
- Conducted data cleaning, addressing missing values, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.

## Model Training

We employed various regression models including the Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets for effective model training.

## Model Evaluation

Model performance was assessed using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as a crucial evaluation metric. Visual representations of the MAE for each model were included to provide insights into their respective performances. Accuracy is also calculated in order to get an all-around perspective of the model performance.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the effective utilization of machine learning models in predicting calories burned during exercise. Continuous improvements and feature engineering can significantly enhance the accuracy of the models.
